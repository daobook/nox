"Nox is super easy to get started with, and super powerful right out of "
"the box. But when things get complex or you want to chain together some "
"more powerful tasks, often the only examples can be found hunting around "
"GitHub for novel sessions."

"This cookbook is intended to be a centralized, community-driven "
"repository of awesome Nox sessions to act as a source of inspiration and "
"a reference guide for nox's users. If you're doing something cool with "

"Anyone can contribute sessions to the cookbook. However, there are a few "
"guiding principles you should keep in mind:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook.rst:25
msgid ""
"Your session should be interesting or unique, it should do something out "
"of the ordinary or otherwise interesting."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook.rst:26
msgid "You should explain briefly what it does and why it's interesting."

msgid ""
"Releasing a new version of an open source project can be a real pain, "
"with lots of intricate steps. Tools like `Bump2Version "
"<https://github.com/c4urself/bump2version>`_ really help here."
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook.rst:82
msgid "Even more so with a sprinkling of Nox:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../cookbook.rst:129
msgid ""
"Now a simple ``nox -s release -- patch`` will automate your release "
"(provided you have Bump2Version set up to change your files). This is "
"especially powerful if you have a CI/CD pipeline set up!"
